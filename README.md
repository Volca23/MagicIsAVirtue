Hello, I'm Max!
I don't generally use Github much but I do work with some Java and a little bit of Python.
Also admittedly I've just been kinda lazy with developing stuff on my own, however I can help wrap up something that needs to be worked on.

To anyone reading this, I just want to say thank you, and please remember:
We don't work hard to avoid becoming the janitor.
We work hard to improve the lives of people like the janitors.
